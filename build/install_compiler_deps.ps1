.SYNOPSIS
    Adds specified relative paths to the user's PATH environment variable.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script takes a base directory as its first parameter and adds all paths listed in the $PATHS variable
    (relative to the base directory) to the user's PATH environment variable if they exist.
.PARAMETER BasePath
    The base directory against which relative paths in $PATHS will be resolved.
.EXAMPLE
    .\AddToPath.ps1 "C:\MyProjects"
    This will add all paths listed in $PATHS (relative to C:\MyProjects) to the user's PATH.
